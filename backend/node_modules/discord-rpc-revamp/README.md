# Discord RPC Revamp
Note: This package is a revamp of [@discordjs/rpc](https://npmjs.com/package/discord-rpc), because I felt like it didn't work very well - so I rewrote it.

## The code is messy, but here are some useful tips:
 - The API is the same as in [@discordjs/rpc](https://npmjs.com/package/discord-rpc), except `login()` is now `connect()` and does not take a client secret.
 - Calling `subscribe()` will subscribe the client instance to the event, to handle it use `client.on('EVENT', function handler() {})`
 - List of events, methods, general guide on RPC (outdated but mostly relevant): [link](https://robins.one/notes/discord-rpc-documentation.html)

## Example
```js
let client = new (require('discord-rpc-revamp').Client)();
client.connect({ clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE' }).catch(console.error);

client.on('ready', _ => {
    client.setActivity({
        details: 'Discord Rich Presence',
        state: 'Hello there!',
        startTimestamp: Date.now()
    }).then(_ => console.log('set activity')).catch(console.error);

    client.subscribe('ACTIVITY_JOIN');
    client.subscribe('ACTIVITY_JOIN_REQUEST');

    client.on('ACTIVITY_JOIN', data => {
        console.log('ACTIVITY_JOIN', data);
    });
});
```

Enjoy!
